    "\n",
    "One of Rayâ€™s strengths is the ability to leverage multiple machines in the same program. Ray can, of course, be run on a single machine (and is done so often), but the real power is using Ray on a cluster of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ray cluster consists of a head node and a set of worker nodes. The **head node** needs to be started first, and the **worker nodes** are given the address of the head node to form the cluster:\n",

    "You can use the Ray Cluster Launcher to provision machines and launch a multi-node Ray cluster. You can use the cluster launcher on AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Aliyun, on-premise, and Staroid or even on your custom node provider. Ray clusters can also make use of the Ray Autoscaler, which allows Ray to interact with a cloud provider to request or release instances following a specification and according to application workload."

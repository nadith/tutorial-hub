    "## Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Git Prune, Git Fetch --prune, and Git Remote Prune?\n",
    "\n",
    "`git remote prune` and `git fetch --prune` do the same thing: delete the refs to branches that don't exist on the remote. This is highly desirable when working in a team workflow in which remote branches are deleted after merge to main. The second command, `git fetch --prune` will connect to the remote and fetch the latest remote state before pruning. It is essentially a combination of commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch --all && git remote prune`\n",
    "\n",
    "The generic `git prune` command is entirely different. As discussed in the overview section, `git prune` will delete locally detached commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Do I Clean Outdated Branches?\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch --prune` is the best utility for cleaning outdated branches. It will connect to a shared remote repository remote and fetch all remote branch refs. It will then delete remote refs that are no longer in use on the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does Git Remote Prune Origin Delete the Local Branch?\n",
    "\n",
    "No `git remote prune origin` will only delete the refs to remote branches that no longer exist. Git stores both local and remote refs. A repository will have `local/origin` and `remote/origin` ref collections. `git remote prune origin` will only prune the refs in ``remote/origin``. This safely leaves local work in local/origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Prune Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git prune` command is intended to be invoked as a child command to `git gc`. It is highly unlikely you will ever need to invoke `git prune` in a day to day software engineering capacity. Other commands are needed to understand the effects of `git prune`. Some commands used in this article were git log, `git reflog`, and `git checkout`."

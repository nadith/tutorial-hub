<tag>- Ref: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ArturoDent.launch-config</tag>

This vscode extension allows you to create settings to launch any number of your launch.json configurations or compound configurations via separate keybindings. These launch configs can be in any root folder in a multi-root workspace. And a launch config from one root folder can be triggered while in a file from a different root folder. And you can create arrays of launch configs to run with a single keybinding.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

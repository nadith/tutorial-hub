## What Is Gravatar?

An `avatar` is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.

A Gravatar is a `G`lobally `R`ecognized `Avatar`. You upload an image and create your public profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image and public profile will automatically follow you there.

Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every WordPress.com account and is run and supported by Automattic.

# 5. Code with Show Code

Since Markdown Preview Enhanced supports rending diagrams with code blocks, it is impossible to show the code itself. 

```mermaid
pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 85
    "Rats" : 15
```

Use the following to show the code.

<r2>\# TODO: Test the following in GitHub</r2>
> <note>HTML tags below might not work in GitHub, since it strips them off.<note>

<details>
    <summary>Show code</summary>

    ```mermaid
    pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
        "Dogs" : 386
        "Cats" : 85
        "Rats" : 15
    ```
